# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub Repository! 🌟

Hi there! I'm **Sumedh Sathe**, a passionate researcher and a Ph.D. candidate at the prestigious **Clemson University's International Center for Automotive Research (ICAR)**, nestled in the vibrant city of Greenville, SC. I'm thrilled to share my journey and research in the cutting-edge realm of **Robotics** and **Applied Artificial Intelligence**. 🚗 :robot:

## 🚀 About My Research:
My research focuses on developing robust scalable frameworks for **data-driven modeling, motion planning,** and **control for Ground-based Locomotion**. I'm on a mission to transform theoretical concepts into practical workflows, addressing the challenges modern robotic systems face in unstructured environments.

🔍 **Key Highlights:**
- **Hybrid Deep Reinforcement Learning Controllers**: Developing Adaptive Data-Driven Controllers leveraging inferencing strength of self-supervised learning methods along with the safety and theoretical gaurantees provided by model-based control.
- **Koopman Operator Theory**: Expanding the horizons of explainable data-driven modeling with analytical formulation of Koopman Operators for robotics.
- **Fault Tolerant Control**: Extending operational capabilities in harsh scenarios while delivering robustness against seen as well as unseen failure modes.
- **Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion & Estimation**: Designing robust sensing frameworks that exploit multiple modalities and addressing semantic inconsistencies
By blending these methodologies, I aim to enhance intelligence and decision-making capabilities in autonomous robots, pushing their performance margins.

## 🌱 My Interests:
I'm captivated by the potential of **autonomous robots and vehicles** to address real-world challenges. My goal is to develop solutions that improve our environment and lifestyle through thoughtful engineering.

## 🤝 Collaboration and Contributions:
I'm always looking forward to collaborating with like-minded individuals and teams to solve challenging problems in robotics and autonomy. Together, we can pool our expertise and create elegant and reliable solutions.
